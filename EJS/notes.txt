EJS

Why we need it ? 

Because if we need to update some data in html file again and again like name
and other stuff then it give a headache but with the help of ejs as a extension 
name you can use it like javascript variable with this 

like you have <p> Hii, <%= name%> </p> here name is a javasript variable

but there is a some problem like if write wrond var name as we assign a value in
javascript then it give error but we can withstand it with help of locals 
it is a object of object. so here if we locals.name then it give the data 
which store in name and if i give wrong variable name it just put empty or nan 
in it so it did not give error just there is only empty is here in this example
here only have "hii, " thats it

Views --> a predefine directory so i did need to give full address if something 
is in views directory just need the name of the file


What if we need to send static file then what do we doo?

then make folder and make them static with the help of express.static() 
but we need a path for this then we use path module mainly path.join() and
path.resolve() to join the absolute the path and the folder with this we 
can do but then how to use it still giving error then all we have to do 
servername.use use is a function where we write all above we do for making folder 
static to get the file but there is one problem if you make that specific folder then you can get all file and open it in browser if you know the name of the 
file so be carefull


So lets make a contact form and make api to learn how things work

    in this we make form and make method post and action contact so after that we
    make our temporary database which is simple array and add middleware
    urlencode make them true so the we can get the data from it after that
    we make some endpoints like contact , sucess etc after words we make a 
    single api function which is users where we can see the data easily
