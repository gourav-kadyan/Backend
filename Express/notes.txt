Express Js

    --- it is a node js 
    --- typically use for better syntax and short code and for more readable
    --- making server is very easy


    Scripts : 

        -- in package.json we create two script one is start and another is dev 
        -- in start we just use node "filename" and in dev we do nodemon "filename"
        -- one for development and one for production

        -- here we do command npm run dev/start but with start we can do npm start also

    app.get --> to get the data
    app.post --> create the data
    app.put --> update the data
    app.delete --> for deleting the data

    we use path here also
        path.resolve() --> give the absolute path of location
        path.join() to join the specific two path of strings
    

IMP : IF WE WANT TO SEND THE FILE BUT CHANGE THEIR DATA FOR DIFF FOR DIFFERENT USER LIKE THEIR
        NAME THEN WE NEED TO USE "EJS -- EMBEDDED JAVASCRIPT TEMPLATE" FOR THAT 
        WHICH IS IN NEXT FOLDER
